hello-world-altera

compile the OpenCL example program with Intel FPGA OpenCL SDK. This should test your OpenCL programming environment.

Tested on the following platforms:

Ubuntu 16.04 + Intel FPGA OpenCL SDK 16.1


this was copied from the class git repo and the code from the version that runs on windows was pasted into mykernel.cl and main.c
to see if it will compile and run like the original on the devcloud

the version that runs on windows was a combination of the hello-world (non altera) and the gpuopencl project from visaul studio
